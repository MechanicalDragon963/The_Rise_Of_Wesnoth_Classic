    description= _ "Among the Wesfolk, there are still craftsmen capable of creating a true battle chariot. It is a much more skillful war machine, and its appearance is reminiscent of the heyday of Wesfolk culture. Such chariots were used by the Wesfolk to conquer the plains of the Old Continent in ancient times. Now they are ridden by the senior outlaws. At high speed, in the thick of battle, the blood of their glorious warrior ancestors boils in them, and urges them to fight as bravely and fiercely."
