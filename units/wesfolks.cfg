        description= _"Humans of the Green Isle met Wesfolk as a people of crude bridands, but this wasn't always the case. The Ancient Wesfolk inhabited vast territories of the Old Continent. They had their priests, their cities, their kingdoms.
        
Sorcerers of Wesfolk always gravitated towards the art of shadows and darkness. Legends say that misfortunes and decay befell Wesfolk exactly after their dark mages had discovered the secret of everlasting life. Lich Lords were powerful but lacked any respect for a human life. They used their human subjects as mere tools, waged bloody wars and conducted dark studies.

Necromancy worsened relations with neighbours. After a series of catastrophic conflicts combined with endless internal strife, most of their kin had to flee to the Green Isle. Summoning of the orcs became the final and ultimate sign of their fall: the fear of defeat and imminent end of their unlife made the Lich-Lords betray their own people.

That's how the once great Wesfolk people turned into gangs of miserable outlaws."
